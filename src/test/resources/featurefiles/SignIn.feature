Feature: As a QA, I would like to verify all negative scenarios for login

  Scenario Outline: : User should not be able to login with invalid credential
    Given User is on www.bbc.co.uk homepage
    And  User clicks on Sign in tab
    When User enters username as "<username>"
    And User enters password as "<password>"
    And User clicks on Sign in button
    Then user gets the error message as "<error>" for "<Feild>"
    Examples:
    | username           | password               | Feild       | error                                                                                                |
